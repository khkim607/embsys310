### a. What is Morse Code?

- Morse code is a telecommunication method of transmitting encoded 26 text characters and 10 numbers of zero to nine in stanadrdized sequence of two different signal durations, "dot" and "dashes" or "dits" and "dahs". The execution of Morse code have many different ways depending on the medium and code generation devices, such as electric current, radio waves, visible light, or sound waves. 

- Since its invention in 1837, Morse code has been evolved from __*American Morse Code*__ to __*International Morse Code*__ finalized in 1865. 

### b. Who developed Morse Code?

- American artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse developed a concept of his idea of single wire telegraph using "Morse code", a forerunner of well known "International Morse Code" in 1832. Samuel Morse's original code developed in 1837 has been refined to include special characters with the help of American machinist Alfred Veil in 1840. This code was used in first public demonstration of american electric telegraph at Morristown, New Jersey in 1838. 

- Though english inventors William Cook and Charles Wheatstone demonstrated first electric telegraph in England in 1937, Smanuel Moore and Alfred Veils telegraph system using "repeater" had cirtical advantage over the english competitor's. Using relay as repeaters in certain distances makes it possible to transmit the signal beyond the distance without repeater. 

- After the Morse code became internationally popular, German journalist, Friedrich Clemens Gerke, improved the work of Morse and Veil by simplyfing the different length dashes and different inter-element spaces of American Morse code, leaving only two coding elements, the dot and the dash. 

- In summary, the Morse code was originally developed by Samuel Morse, however, modern day International Morse code is completed by later refinment of Alfred Veil and Frederich Celmens Gerke.
